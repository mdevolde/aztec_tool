*A fast, pure‑Python Aztec Code reader with auto‑orientation and Reed-Solomon correction.*

-------------

Please note that the library is still under development, and some features are unstable. Typically, some Aztec files can be read incorrectly because the image has been exported incorrectly in matrix.

All contributions are welcome!

## Installation

This library is compatible with **Python 3.9** and above.

To install the latest version of Aztec tool, you can use pip. Open your terminal and run the following command (in a virtual environment if you want to keep your system clean):

```bash
pip install --upgrade aztec_tool
```

If you cloned the repository, you can install it using pip as well, in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pip install --upgrade .
```

This library installs the following dependencies:
- [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) for image processing
- [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) for numerical operations
- [Reed-Solomon](https://pypi.org/project/reedsolo/) for error correction
- [toml](https://pypi.org/project/toml/) for version reading

## Usage
The library allows you to decode Aztec barcodes from images.

The most common way to use the library is to use the `AztecDecoder` class. You can create an instance of the class and call the `decode` method with the path to the image file as an argument. With this class, you need to have your Aztec barcode perfectly cropped in an image.

```python
>>> from aztec_tool import decode
>>> decode("welcome_lib.jpg")
'Welcome to Aztec tool lib !'
>>>
```

If you need to access more specific data, you can use the `AztecDecoder` class directly:

```python
>>> from aztec_tool import AztecDecoder
>>> decoder = AztecDecoder("welcome_lib.jpg")
>>> decoder.aztec_type
<AztecType.COMPACT: 0>
>>> decoder.mode_info
{'layers': 3, 'data_words': 21, 'ecc_bits': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}
>>> decoder.decode()
'Welcome to Aztec tool lib !'
```

If you don't have the Aztec barcode perfectly cropped in an image, you can use this class to cropper it automatically:
```python
>>> from aztec_tool import MultiAztecDecoder
>>> multi_decoder = MultiAztecDecoder("welcome_lib_non_cropped.jpg")
>>> decoder = multi_decoder.decoders[0]
>>> decoder.aztec_type
<AztecType.COMPACT: 0>
>>> decoder.mode_info
{'layers': 3, 'data_words': 21, 'ecc_bits': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}
>>> decoder.decode()
'Welcome to Aztec tool lib !'
```

When you're using the `decode` function or the `AztecDecoder` (or `MultiAztecDecoder`) class, you can also pass three optional parameters:
- `auto_orient`: Default is `True`. If set to `True`, the image will be automatically rotated to the correct orientation before decoding. This is useful if the barcode is reversed or rotated.
- `auto_correct`: Default is `True`. If set to `True`, the data in the Aztec barcode will be automatically corrected. This is useful if the barcode is damaged or has errors.
- `auto_mode_correct`: Default is `True`. If set to `True`, the mode data in the Aztec barcode will be automatically corrected. This is useful if the barcode is damaged or has errors.

If you have some problems with the correction, it can be useful to set `auto_correct` and/or `auto_mode_correct` to `False`.

If you need very specific data, you can access the `AztecDecoder` class attributes, or directly the various classes used in the library.

This library has its own exceptions. You can find them in the `exceptions.py` file. The most common exception is `AztecDecoderError`, which is the parent class of all the exceptions in the library.

The tool is also available as a command line interface (CLI). You can use it by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ aztec-tool welcome_lib.jpg
Welcome to Aztec tool lib !
```

If you want to print the metadata of the Aztec code, you can use the `--info` option:

```bash
$ aztec-tool welcome_lib.jpg --info
Type:         COMPACT
Layers:       3
Data words:   21
ECC bits:     01010101010010101000
```

You can view all available options by running `aztec-tool -h`.
